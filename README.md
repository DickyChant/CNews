# CNews
CNews means see news, it is an android app developed by Clarence.

## Intro
At first, I am not interested in writing android app at all. After all, I prefer to use ios devices. However, this project is the homework of my required java class.

This app is a news app. Or you can simply call it rss reader. The news mainly comes from http://rss.qq.com/index.shtml, which stops update many columns for years. So it can be "olds" reader. You may find news in 2016.

As you can imagine, the time for the project is really short, just about a week. A week ago, I don't have any experience in Android programming (I don't have any now, either). Therefore, it is not hard to notice that the code is poorly written and awfully constructed, with a lot lines of annotations not deleted. And I have no plan to reconstruct it at all.

However, this app may be useful for you in some ways. The way to parse rss, the login UI, the layout... You can clone or fork it freely.
